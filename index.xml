      <title>Welcome to the LLM Risks Seminar</title>

      <description>Full Transcript
 Seminar Plan The actual seminar won&amp;rsquo;t be fully planned by GPT-4, but more information on it won&amp;rsquo;t be available until later.
I&amp;rsquo;m expecting the structure and format to that combines aspects of this seminar on adversarial machine learning and this course on computing ethics, but with a topic focused on learning as much as we can about the potential for both good and harm from generative AI (including large language models) and things we can do (mostly technically, but including policy) to mitigate the harms.</description>
