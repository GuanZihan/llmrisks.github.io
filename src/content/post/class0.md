For this week, Team 1 should finalize the post by this Thursday
(5:29pm), and Team 2 should send me (email to <A
href="mailto:evans@virginia.edu">evans@virginia.edu</a>) the plan for
week 2 by Sunday, 27 August and have materials ready for posting by
the next Wednesday.

The teams have been posted at [https://github.com/llmrisks/discussions/blob/main/teams.md](https://github.com/llmrisks/discussions/blob/main/teams.md) (visible only to the class). Everyone should have gotten an invite to the github organization, but if not please check with me.
