The actual seminar won't be fully planned by GPT-4, but more
information on it won't be available until later. I'm expecting the
structure and format to be similar to [this
seminar](https://secml.github.io/), but with a topic focused on
learning as much as we can about the potential for both good and harm
from generative AI (including large language models) and things we can
do (mostly technically, but including policy) to mitigate the harms.
