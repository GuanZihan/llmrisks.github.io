Everyone should have received an invitation to the github discussions
site, and be able to see the posts there and submit your own posts and
comments. If you didn't get this invitation, it was probably blocked
by the email system. Try visiting:

[https://github.com/orgs/llmrisks/invitation](https://github.com/orgs/llmrisks/invitation)

(while logged into the github account you listed on your form).

Once you've accepted the invitation, you should be able to visit
[https://github.com/llmrisks/discussions/discussions/2](https://github.com/llmrisks/discussions/discussions/2)
(the now-finalized discussion post for Week 1), and contribute to the
discussions there.
