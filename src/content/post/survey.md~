## Seminar Plan

The actual seminar won't be fully planned by GPT-4, but more
information on it won't be available until later.

I'm expecting the structure and format to that combines aspects of
[this seminar on adversarial machine
learning](https://secml.github.io/syllabus/) and [this course on
computing ethics](https://csethics.github.io/syllabus/), but with a
topic focused on learning as much as we can about the potential for
both good and harm from generative AI (including large language
models) and things we can do (mostly technically, but including
policy) to mitigate the harms.

**Expected Background:** Students are not required to have prior
  background in machine learing or security, but will be expected to
  learn whatever background they need on these topics mostly on their
  own. The seminar is open to ambitious undergraduate students and
  research-focused graduate students with interests in machine
  learning, privacy, fairness, security, and related
  topics. Instructor permission is required to enroll, and decisions
  about enrollment will be based on what you are able to bring to the
  seminar.

**Seminar Format:** The details will be worked out later, but the
  basic structure will divide the class into three or four teams
  (somewhat like what was done , each with set responsibilities for
  each week of the seminar. One team will be responsible for leading
  the seminar, including selecting readings/viewings/activities for
  the rest of the course and leading discussions in class (with help
  from the instructor). Another team will be responsible for writing a
  "blog" that summarizes the content of the week.

**Content:** We expect the content will be a mix of technical
  background papers, recent research papers, and less formal writings
  and videos. Although we will focus on understanding technical
  aspects of the issues, we will also consider non-technical ones
  including societal impacts and legal and policy aspects.

## Readings

Some initial ideas for course readings will be posted, but it will be
largely up to the student teams leading to select good readings for
the topics to consider.
