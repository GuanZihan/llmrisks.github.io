<h1 id="leading-team-schedule">Leading Team Schedule</h1>
<p>As the leading team, your job is to select a worthwhile topic, decide
on a reading assignment (which can include things other than reading
and is not limited to typical research papers) for the class, write
questions that the class should write responses to in preparation for
the discussion, and lead an interesting, engaging, and illuminating
class!</p>
<p>You have two class sessions to present your topic (Monday and
Wednesday meetings), so please don&rsquo;t just give a series of
unconnected, dull presentations. You need to think of things to do in
class to make it more worthwhile and engaging.</p>
<p><strong>Two weeks and a day</strong> before your team is scheduled to lead, you
should have an idea what you want to do, tentative list of readings
or other materials, and send this to me by 5:29pm on the Sunday. For
example, the team leading on 11/13 September should send the plan on
Sunday, August 27. I will give you some quick feedback on this, and
we can meet after class on Monday to discuss.</p>
<p><strong>One week and a day</strong> before your team is scheduled to lead, you
should submit a PR to the course website to post the materials for
the week on the course site. So, the team leading on 11/13 September
should do this by Sunday, September 3 at 5:29pm. Assuming I am happy
with your plan, this will be posted shortly after on the course
website.</p>
<p>For teams leading the first few weeks, this schedule is not possible,
so is adjusted in the schedule below. The team leading 28/30 August
will get a rough plan from me on the first class, and submit a plan
for posting by 5:29pm on <strong>Thursday, 24 August</strong>. The team leading the
second week 4/6 September should decide on a general plan for the week
and send it to me by 5:29pm on <strong>Thursday, 24 August</strong>. Then, the
materials should be ready for posting by <strong>Sunday, 27 August</strong>.</p>
<p>After you&rsquo;ve completed the class meeting, you should help the Blogging
team by providing them with your materials, answering their questions,
and reviewing their write-up.</p>
<p><strong>Preparation Deadlines</strong></p>
<p>All deadlines are at 5:29pm on the date listed.</p>

<h2 id="blogging-team">Blogging Team</h2>
<p>The blogging team is responsible for writing a post that summarizes
the materials and discussion for the class. A draft of the blog should
be submitted as a pull request no later than the following Monday (so
the blog for the week of August 28/30 is due on Monday, 4 September.</p>
<p>Before the scheduled class, develop a team plan for how to manage the
blogging. One team member should be designated the team leader for the
blogging. The blogging leader is responsible for making sure the team
is well coordinated and everyone knows what they are doing and follows
through on this. The blogging team should take detailed notes (this
can be distributed among the team â€” make sure you know who is
responsible for taking notes on each part).</p>
<p>Note that as the blogging team, you are not expected to post responses
or questions this week (although you may if you want to, of course),
but you are still expected to participate actively in the class.</p>
<p>By the Monday following class, have a draft of the blog post ready,
and share it with the rest of the class (including the leading team
and coordinators) for comments. Instructions for how to prepare the
blog post are on the <a href="/blogging">Blogging Mechanics page</a>.</p>
<p>By the following Friday, have a final version of the blog post ready
to add to the course site.</p>
